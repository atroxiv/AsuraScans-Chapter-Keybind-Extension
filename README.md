This is a google extension that will bind the previous/next chapter buttons on asurascans.com to the left/right arrows on your keyboard.

To use this you need to go to chrome's extensions window (chrome://extensions), and turn on developer mode with the slider in the top right corner.

After doing that, you can click the "load unpacked" button that appeared in the top left, and select the "extension" folder that you downloaded here.

Feel free to inspect/ steal the code it's not very professional anyways.

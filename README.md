This is a google extension that will bind the previous/next chapter buttons on asurascans.com to the left/right arrows on your keyboard.

To use this you need to go to chrome's extensions window (chrome://extensions), and turn on developer mode with the slider in the top right corner.

Next, unzip the file.

After doing that, you can click the "load unpacked" button that appeared in the top left of the extensions window, and select the "extension" folder that you downloaded here.

Feel free to inspect/take all of the 20 lines of code for yourself.
